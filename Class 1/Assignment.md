# Assignment for Session 1
Please understand the concepts that is mentioned in [notes](notes.md) and write the program for it. The assignment is included with only those topics that are discussed in the session and in the notes with some little bit of trickery. 

### Question 1
Write a program that includes strings and integers in the print statement that does the arithmetic operations such as Addition, Multiplication, Division and Modulo. Also, compare 2 variables for the nature of numbers using lists. (Greater, Lesser or equal)

Steps for the program: 
1. Assign 2 variables ```a``` & ```b``` at the start and perform **Addition, Multiplication and Modulo** operations and assign each operations to a variable 
```x```, ```y```and ```z```. 
2. Print ```x```, ```y``` and ```z``` in seperate line. 
3. Compare ```x```, ```y``` & ```z``` using **greater than (>) or less than (<) operators** and print the number that is greater using ```if``` condition.
4. Create lists ```c``` and ```d``` having 5 seperate numbers each and compare each numbers in the list and print which is greater, lesser or equal to one another using for loop.
5. At the end, print the version of Python that you are using in your system. (Both format and concatination should be used and at the start of print statement it should me mentioned. Eg. ```print("Using Format:...."```))

Program should contain an ```expression```, a ```statement``` and it should have ```if``` condition and ```for``` loop with the ```lists```.
